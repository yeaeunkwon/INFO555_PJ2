Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.

By incorporating statistical information concerning allowable phoneme sequences in English, they increased the overall phoneme recognition accuracy for words consisting of two or more phonemes. Since the late 1970s, dynamic programming in numerous variant forms, including the Viterbi algorithm [54] which came from the communication theory community, has become an indispensable technique in automatic speech recognition. Since signal processing and computer technologies were yet very primitive, most of the speech recognition systems investigated used spectral resonances during the vowel region of each utterance which were extracted from output signals of an analog filter bank and logic circuits.", "label": "SUPPORTS"}

More than one narrative, Ellis weaves in and out of multiple stories: Bret's relationships and secret homosexuality, his writing and possible work on a script for his girlfriend's father, the Trawler's vicious crimes, Robert Mallory's effect on Bret's group of friends, drug use, and more. Lastly, and perhaps more noticeable than anything else, The Shards is a very personal work of metafiction in which Bret Easton Ellis shares not only a name with his narrator but also a novel (Less Than Zero), a plethora of identity markers and obsessions, and a school (the author photo used for this novel is from Ellis' 1982 yearbook from Buckley School). Despite the multiplicity of intertwining narratives, Ellis masterfully keeps Bret at the center of everything and the narrator's voice, not to mention his growing paranoia, is more than enough to keep readers turning pages. Hermetic, paranoid, sleek, dark \u2014 and with brief explosions of the sex and violence that have characterized Ellis' oeuvre \u2014 The Shards is a stark reminder that the American Psycho author is a genre unto himself.", "label": "SUPPORTS"}

That he would have been exiled there is common:\n\n\"Early tradition says that John was banished to Patmos by the Roman authorities. Were we to receive word that a certain person was familiar with the Bronx, Manhattan, Newark, Hoboken, and we have written correspondance to them where he claims to be at Hsing Hsing prison - especially absent any transportation - it would not at all be unreasonable to assume he is from New York. When tradition thus states that John was living in the biggest city of the area, and we have written correspndance that shows how close he was, it's a really safe bet.

It has been widely believed that in the 1975 Conservative leadership contest, many Conservative MPs voted for Thatcher primarily because they were determined to replace Heath, and most of the other leadership contenders were his allies or associates: \u201cElecting Margaret had simply been the most effective way of getting rid of Ted\u201d (Critchley & Halcrow 1998: 60; see also Riddell 1985: 10). It therefore behoves us to examine more carefully, and with more nuance, how and why Thatcher was elected Conservative leader in early 1975. At this stage, however, her instinctive ideas and philosophy were not fully formed, so that at the time of the Conservative leadership contest, Thatcher had only recently embarked upon her process of political reappraisal and search for a new mode of Conservatism. However, although she undoubtedly attracted support from many Conservative MPs by virtue of not being Heath, this has been exaggerated as the main motive for voting for her, and therefore underestimated the extent to which Thatcher genuinely appealed to some Conservative MPs in her own right, either due to her apparent personal qualities or/and her nascent right-wing views.", "label": "SUPPORTS"}

Here, we uncover 20 fascinating insights into Wallace\u2018s life, legend and enduring legacy, separating fact from fiction to reveal a complex figure of undeniable historical importance. Some scholars question the story of Wallace\u2018s wife being killed by the English, noting it first appears in Blind Harry\u2018s largely fictionalized version of events two centuries later. The spark of rebellion\n\nThe tipping point came in 1297, when Wallace killed William Heselrig, the English High Sheriff of Lanark, in retaliation for the murder of Wallace\u2018s wife (or possibly another family member).", "Question_2": "Is there any evidence or sources to support the claim that these events never happened?", "Answer_2": "Key denial assertions are that the murder of approximately six million Jews during World War II never occurred, that the Nazis had no official policy or intention to exterminate the Jews, and that the poison gas chambers in Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp never existed. Common distortions include, for example, assertions that the figure of six million Jewish deaths is an exaggeration and that the diary of Anne Frank is a forgery. Evidence and Documentation of the HolocaustHolocaust denial, distortion, and misuse are strategies used to undermine or cast doubt upon the historical truth of the Holocaust.
